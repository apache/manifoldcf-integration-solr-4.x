     This is a "kitchen sink" config file that tests can use.
     When writting a new test, feel free to add *new* items (plugins,
     config options, etc...) as long as they don't break any existing
     tests.  if you need to test something esoteric please add a new
     "solrconfig-your-esoteric-purpose.xml" config file.

     Note in particular that this test is used by MinimalSchemaTest so
     Anything added to this file needs to work correctly even if there
     is now uniqueKey or defaultSearch Field.
