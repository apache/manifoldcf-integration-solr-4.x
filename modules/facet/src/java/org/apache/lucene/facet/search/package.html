    <h1>Faceted Search API</h1>
    
    API for faceted search has several interfaces - simple, top level ones, adequate for most users,
    and advanced, more complicated ones, for the more advanced users. 
    
    <p>
    
    We now describe the simpler interfaces.
    There are mainly 3 interfaces for faceted search:
    <ol>
      <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.facet.search.params.FacetRequest Facets Request}
          defines requirements:
          <ul> 
              <li>which facets are required, e.g. depth</li>
              <li>what is computed for each facet - e.g. count, score.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.facet.search.FacetsAccumulator Facets Extractor}
          Controls how facets are extracted, with variations of:
          <ul> 
              <li>default (partitioned, like all extractors). </li>
              <li>sampled - inspects only a fraction of the documents.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.facet.search.FacetResultsHandler Facet Results Handler }
          Controls how results are further processed and merged (also between partitions):
          <ul> 
              <li>Top K.</li>
              <li>Tree.</li>
              <li>Tree with top K at each level</li>
              <li>...</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
