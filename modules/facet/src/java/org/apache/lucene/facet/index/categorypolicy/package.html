<h1>Policies for indexing categories</h1>

There are two kinds of policies: 
<ul>
  <li>Path policies are based on the path of the category.</li>
  <li>Ordinal policies are based on the ordinal of the category.</li>
</ul>

Policies are "consulted" with during indexing, for deciding whether a category should
be added to the index or not. The two kinds of policies can be used for different purposes.
For example, path policies dictates which categories can participate in a drill-down operation, 
while ordinal policies affect which can be accumulated (e.g. counted).
