<p>This module supports index-time joins while searching, where joined
  documents are indexed as a single document block using
  {@link org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter#addDocuments}.  This is useful for any normalized content (XML documents or database tables).  In database terms, all rows for all
  joined tables matching a single row of the primary table must be
  indexed as a single document block, with the parent document
  being last in the group.</p>

<p>When you index in this way, the documents in your index are divided
  into parent documents (the last document of each block) and child
  documents (all others).  You provide a {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Filter} that identifies the
  parent documents, as Lucene does not currently record any information
  about doc blocks.</p>

<p>At search time, use {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.BlockJoinQuery} to remap
  matches from any child {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Query} (ie, a query that matches only
  child documents) up to the parent document space.  The resulting
  {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.BlockJoinQuery} can then be used as a clause in any query that
  matches parent documents.</p>

<p>If you only care about the parent documents matching the query, you
  can use any collector to collect the parent hits, but if you'd also
  like to see which child documents match for each parent document,
  use the {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.BlockJoinCollector} to collect the hits. Once the
  search is done, you retrieve a {@link
  org.apache.lucene.search.grouping.TopGroups} instance from the
  {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.BlockJoinCollector#getTopGroups} method.</p>
