<p>This module enables search result grouping with Lucene, where hits
with the same value in the specified single-valued group field are
grouped together.  For example, if you group by the <tt>author</tt>
field, then all documents with the same value in the <tt>author</tt>
field fall into a single group.</p>

<p>Grouping requires a number of inputs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> <tt>groupField</tt>: this is the field used for grouping.
      For example, if you use the <tt>author</tt> field then each
      group has all books by the same author.  Documents that don't
      have this field are grouped under a single group with
      a <tt>null</tt> group value.

    <li> <tt>groupSort</tt>: how the groups are sorted.  For sorting
      purposes, each group is "represented" by the highest-sorted
      document according to the <tt>groupSort</tt> within it.  For
      example, if you specify "price" (ascending) then the first group
      is the one with the lowest price book within it.  Or if you
      specify relevance group sort, then the first group is the one
      containing the highest scoring book.

    <li> <tt>topNGroups</tt>: how many top groups to keep.  For
      example, 10 means the top 10 groups are computed.

    <li> <tt>groupOffset</tt>: which "slice" of top groups you want to
      retrieve.  For example, 3 means you'll get 7 groups back
      (assuming <tt>topNGroups</tt> is 10).  This is useful for
      paging, where you might show 5 groups per page.

    <li> <tt>withinGroupSort</tt>: how the documents within each group
      are sorted.  This can be different from the group sort.

    <li> <tt>maxDocsPerGroup</tt>: how many top documents within each
      group to keep.

    <li> <tt>withinGroupOffset</tt>: which "slice" of top
      documents you want to retrieve from each group.

  </ul>

<p>The implementation is two-pass: the first pass ({@link
  org.apache.lucene.search.grouping.FirstPassGroupingCollector})
  gathers the top groups, and the second pass ({@link
  org.apache.lucene.search.grouping.SecondPassGroupingCollector})
  gathers documents within those groups.  If the search is costly to
  run you may want to use the {@link
  org.apache.lucene.search.CachingCollector} class, which
  caches hits and can (quickly) replay them for the second pass.  This
  way you only run the query once, but you pay a RAM cost to (briefly)
  hold all hits.  Results are returned as a {@link
  org.apache.lucene.search.grouping.TopGroups} instance.</p>

<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The group field must be a single-valued indexed field.
    {@link org.apache.lucene.search.FieldCache} is used to load the {@link org.apache.lucene.search.FieldCache.DocTermsIndex} for this field.
  <li> Unlike Solr's implementation, this module cannot group by
    function query values nor by arbitrary queries.
  <li> Sharding is not directly supported, though is not too
    difficult, if you can merge the top groups and top documents per
    group yourself.
</ul>

<p>Typical usage looks like this (using the {@link org.apache.lucene.search.CachingCollector}):</p>

<pre>
  FirstPassGroupingCollector c1 = new FirstPassGroupingCollector("author", groupSort, groupOffset+topNGroups);

  boolean cacheScores = true;
  double maxCacheRAMMB = 4.0;
  CachingCollector cachedCollector = new CachingCollector(c1, cacheScores, maxCacheRAMMB);
  s.search(new TermQuery(new Term("content", searchTerm)), cachedCollector);

  Collection<SearchGroup> topGroups = c1.getTopGroups(groupOffset, fillFields);

  if (topGroups == null) {
    // No groups matched
    return;
  }

  boolean getScores = true;
  boolean getMaxScores = true;
  boolean fillFields = true;
  SecondPassGroupingCollector c2 = new SecondPassGroupingCollector("author", topGroups, groupSort, docSort, docOffset+docsPerGroup, getScores, getMaxScores, fillFields);

  if (cachedCollector.isCached()) {
    // Cache fit within maxCacheRAMMB, so we can replay it:
    cachedCollector.replay(c2);
  } else {
    // Cache was too large; must re-execute query:
    s.search(new TermQuery(new Term("content", searchTerm)), c2);
  }
        
  TopGroups groupsResult = c2.getTopGroups(docOffset);

  // Render groupsResult...
</pre>
