Grouping Module Change Log

======================= Trunk (not yet released) =======================
   
LUCENE-1421: create new grouping module, enabling search results to be
grouped by a single-valued indexed field.  This module was factored
out of Solr's grouping implementation, except it cannot group by
function queries nor arbitrary queries.  (Mike McCandless)
