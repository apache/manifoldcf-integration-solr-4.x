/**
  * This is an easy-to-use tool that upgrades all segments of an index from previous Lucene versions
  * to the current segment file format. It can be used from command line:
  * <pre>
  *  java -cp lucene-core.jar org.apache.lucene.index.IndexUpgrader [-delete-prior-commits] [-verbose] indexDir
  * </pre>
  * Alternatively this class can be instantiated and {@link #upgrade} invoked. It uses {@link UpgradeIndexMergePolicy}
  * and triggers the upgrade via an optimize request to {@link IndexWriter}.
  * <p>This tool keeps only the last commit in an index; for this
  * reason, if the incoming index has more than one commit, the tool
  * refuses to run by default. Specify {@code -delete-prior-commits}
  * to override this, allowing the tool to delete all but the last commit.
  * From Java code this can be enabled by passing {@code true} to
  * {@link #IndexUpgrader(Directory,Version,PrintStream,boolean)}.
  * <p><b>Warning:</b> This tool may reorder documents if the index was partially
  * upgraded before execution (e.g., documents were added). If your application relies
  * on &quot;monotonicity&quot; of doc IDs (which means that the order in which the documents
  * were added to the index is preserved), do a full optimize instead.
  * The {@link MergePolicy} set by {@link IndexWriterConfig} may also reorder
  * documents.
