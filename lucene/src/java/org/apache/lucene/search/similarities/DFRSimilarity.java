/**
 * Implements the <em>divergence from randomness (DFR)</em> framework
 * introduced in Gianni Amati and Cornelis Joost Van Rijsbergen. 2002.
 * Probabilistic models of information retrieval based on measuring the
 * divergence from randomness. ACM Trans. Inf. Syst. 20, 4 (October 2002),
 * 357-389.
 * <p>The DFR scoring formula is composed of three separate components: the
 * <em>basic model</em>, the <em>aftereffect</em> and an additional
 * <em>normalization</em> component, represented by the classes
 * {@code BasicModel}, {@code AfterEffect} and {@code Normalization},
 * respectively. The names of these classes were chosen to match the names of
 * their counterparts in the Terrier IR engine.</p>
 * <p>Note that <em>qtf</em>, the multiplicity of term-occurrence in the query,
 * is not handled by this implementation.</p>
