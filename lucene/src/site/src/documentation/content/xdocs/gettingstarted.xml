    <title>Getting Started</title>
<p>
This document is intended as a "getting started" guide.  It has three audiences: first-time users
looking to install Apache Lucene in their application; developers looking to modify or base
the applications they develop on Lucene; and developers looking to become involved in and contribute
to the development of Lucene.  This document is written in tutorial and walk-through format.  The
goal is to help you "get started".  It does not go into great depth on some of the conceptual or
inner details of Lucene.
