<h2>Misc Tools</h2>

The misc package has various tools for splitting/merging indices,
changing norms, finding high freq terms, and others.

<h2>DirectIOLinuxDirectory</h2>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: This uses C++ sources (accessible via JNI), which you'll
have to compile on your platform.  Further, this is a very
platform-specific extensions (runs only on Linux, and likely only on
2.6.x kernels).

<p>
DirectIOLinuxDirectory is a Directory implementation that bypasses the
OS's buffer cache for any IndexInput and IndexOutput opened through it
(using the linux-specific O_DIRECT flag).

<p>
Note that doing so typically results in bad performance loss!  You
should not use this for searching, but rather for indexing (or maybe
just merging during indexing), to avoid evicting useful pages from the
buffer cache.

See <a target=_top href="http://chbits.blogspot.com/2010/06/lucene-and-fadvisemadvise.html">here</a>
for details.

Steps to build:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>cd lucene/contrib/misc/</tt>

  <li> To compile NativePosixUtil.cpp -> libNativePosixUtil.so on Linux run<tt> ant build-native-unix</tt>.
  
  <li><tt>libNativePosixUtil.so</tt> will be located in the <tt>lucene/build/native/</tt> folder

  <li> Make sure libNativePosixUtil.so is on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH so java can find it (something like <tt>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dir:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, where /path/to/dir contains libNativePosixUtil.so)

  <li> <tt>ant jar</tt> to compile the java source and put that JAR on your CLASSPATH
</ul>

<p>
To use this, you'll likely want to make a custom subclass of
FSDirectory that only opens direct IndexInput/Output for merging.  One
hackish way to do this is to check if the current thread's name starts
with "Lucene Merge Thread".  Alternatively, you could use this Dir as
is for all indexing ops, but not for searching.

<p>
NativePosixUtil.cpp/java also expose access to the posix_madvise,
madvise, posix_fadvise functions, which are somewhat more cross
platform than O_DIRECT, however, in testing (see above link), these
APIs did not seem to help prevent buffer cache eviction.
