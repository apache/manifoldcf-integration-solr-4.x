This package contains the Precedence Query Parser Implementation

<h2>Lucene Precedence Query Parser</h2>

<p>
The Precedence Query Parser extends the Standard Query Parser and enables 
the boolean precedence. So, the query <a AND b OR c AND d> is parsed to 
<(+a +b) (+c +d)> instead of <+a +b +c +d>.
</p>
<p>
Check {@link org.apache.lucene.queryParser.standard.StandardQueryParser} for more details about the
supported syntax and query parser functionalities.
